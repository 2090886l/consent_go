This is a level 4 Software engineering project called "A Blockchain system for managing informed consent".

It contains the source code for the chaincode and web applications for the initial and final designs.

Initial design
/chaincode - contains the chaincode 
/webapp - contains the Node.js application

Final design - 
/chaincode_v2 - contains the chaincode 
/webapp_v2 - contains the Node.js application

To run this code, one must have a running Bluemix Blockchain instance, deploy the chaincode and modify the web application
to point to the blockchain network.
